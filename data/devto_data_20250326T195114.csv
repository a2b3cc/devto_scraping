The first line in the announcement describes them as ""next steps we\'re taking"" and the conclusion promises ""in the coming months we‚Äôll be sharing more about this exciting effort.""

This is something they\'re still working on?', 'Usually when you say a programming language is fast, you mean its code executes quickly.', ""This case doesn't apply to TypeScript, as it doesn't provide an execution environment.

Let\'s go back to the jQuery days. jQuery is awesome, even if it is already in the list of banned technologies at companies. I agree. But the ""ridiculous amount"" of websites still using it may not be due to its greatness. It might be because of its timing: It was the first of its kind.', ""Moving forward, we encounter React. This one was the child with the silver spoon: Not only was it the child of a big company, it appeared early enough to wow the world. In retrospective, people should have stuck with knockout.js, but that's a different story."", ""Moving forward, enter Vue, Svelte, SolidJS. Vue did a great job bringing simplicity to the now chaotic React, but then, the next kings came. Yes, I do consider Svelte and SolidJS the next royalty. Why? Because these are the frameworks that really did it. But I'll talk about that a bit later."", 'Point being here: If we discourage innovation, if we are dismissive of new attempts, we will not advance. Just because only a few percentage is worth it, we should... nay, we must never stop trying new things.', ""About the money: Job security is around React and Angular, true. But will this hold true forever? No chance. Actually, if you're really smart, you'll promote and foster change and research. Better than hoping things will never change is driving the change yourself. Embracing change is always the better option, but has to be done responsibly."", 'Before Svelte, ""React is so performant because of its Virtual DOM algorithm"". After Svelte, ""React is so slow because of its Virtual DOM algorithm"". This is a well-proven fact. What once was a great strength, Rich Harris tore down to tiny pieces and fed the dogs with the remains.', 'Close by was Ryan Carniato cooking something just as awesome, aguably more awesome to be exact: Signals. Well, at this point I should bring knockout.js again, as it was, to the best of my knowledge, the first signal-based library. Still, full credit to Ryan Carniato, author of SolidJS. He saw it, he evolved it, and damn, it was great. So great, Svelte favored signals over compiled reactivity, which brings us to present times.', ""Yes! There is no doubt. For people that are unaware, see the benchmarks for yourself. The once great React is in the bottom. Angular? Definitely hotter, but still significantly down. And who's on top? You guessed it: The new royalty. Svelte and SolidJS are the top performers that are in good enough shape to be seriously considered to take over."", ""But we haven't advanced in performance only. Svelte is so much simpler than React it's scary. Svelte can do React's job in around 30% less code, and can do it better. Svelte's DX is superior, and I don't say this, developers around the world say this."", 'So what should we infer of all this?

This situation gave rise to the fact that developers outside large companies after a while already demanded that development be as simple as possible. The simpler the development environment was (and languages with technologies, of course), the more developers outside of large companies received large companies and, as a result, more profit (a prime example of Flash technology). New developers are already coming to development environments in which simplicity is above all and they are simply afraid to go down a level, they think that black magic is going on there, and when they encounter a problem at a lower level, they think that it is enough to go to stackoveflow or write an issue on github and there are already dark lords lower levels versed in black magic just solve the problem.

The issue is that the key on the backend is being generated with obj.user.id in the serializer. This needs to be changed to obj.user.username if you want to match the username on the front end.
