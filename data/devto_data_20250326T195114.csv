The announcement says TypeScript\'s native implementation ""will drastically improve editor startup..."" The first line in the announcement describes them as ""next steps we\'re taking"" and the conclusion promises ""in the coming months we’ll be sharing more about this exciting effort."" (At one point it even talks about what we\'ll see in TypeScript 7 ""upon release."") So.... This isn\'t here yet, right? This is something they\'re still working on?', 'Usually when you say a programming language is fast, you mean its code executes quickly.', ""This case doesn't apply to TypeScript, as it doesn't provide an execution environment. The goal of TypeScript as an executable is to compile code to JavaScript."", 'So, with a 10x increase in performance they probably mean just that.

I guess I was expecting Microsoft to say ""a 10x faster TypeScript compiler"" in their headline (and not ""a 10x faster TypeScript""), since as you point out this is all about the compiler and not the language.', 'It does look like you can build and run the Go code now in the new working repo Microsoft links to in their announcement.

Let\'s go back to the jQuery days. jQuery is awesome, even if it is already in the list of banned technologies at companies. I agree.

In retrospective, people should have stuck with knockout.js, but that's a different story."", ""Moving forward, enter Vue, Svelte, SolidJS. Vue did a great job bringing simplicity to the now chaotic React, but then, the next kings came. Yes, I do consider Svelte and SolidJS the next royalty. Why? Because these are the frameworks that really did it. But I'll talk about that a bit later."", 'Point being here: If we discourage innovation, if we are dismissive of new attempts, we will not advance.

But will this hold true forever? No chance. Actually, if you're really smart, you'll promote and foster change and research. Better than hoping things will never change is driving the change yourself. Embracing change is always the better option, but has to be done responsibly."", 'Before Svelte, ""React is so performant because of its Virtual DOM algorithm"". After Svelte, ""React is so slow because of its Virtual DOM algorithm"". This is a well-proven fact. What once was a great strength, Rich Harris tore down to tiny pieces and fed the dogs with the remains.', 'Close by was Ryan Carniato cooking something just as awesome, aguably more awesome to be exact: Signals. Well, at this point I should bring knockout.js again, as it was, to the best of my knowledge, the first signal-based library. Still, full credit to Ryan Carniato, author of SolidJS. He saw it, he evolved it, and damn, it was great. So great, Svelte favored signals over compiled reactivity, which brings us to present times.', ""Yes! There is no doubt. For people that are unaware, see the benchmarks for yourself. The once great React is in the bottom. Angular? Definitely hotter, but still significantly down. And who's on top? You guessed it: The new royalty. Svelte and SolidJS are the top performers that are in good enough shape to be seriously considered to take over."", ""But we haven't advanced in performance only. Svelte is so much simpler than React it's scary. Svelte can do React's job in around 30% less code, and can do it better. Svelte's DX is superior, and I don't say this, developers around the world say this."", 'So what should we infer of all this?

Keep it simple or it would cause too complex.\nFinally release. You need to decide your approach here: do we merge back to develop? Shall we squash, rebase, merge or do something else? What should be done when someone is merging us as a base? Ffonly?\nDeployment. Is it a release or deployment?\nI skipped the part with storage as each type has different approach: GitHub has forked repos and pull requests, kernel has merge requests over mail, some have pull request from branch where repo is semi-public but some branches are protected.\nI also skipped branching of different releases.

The idea was that developers outside of the big companies would do the least amount of effort and get the most out of it, while the developers inside the big companies would stay very experienced and develop those development tools. This situation gave rise to the fact that developers outside large companies after a while already demanded that development be as simple as possible. The simpler the development environment was (and languages with technologies, of course), the more developers outside of large companies received large companies and, as a result, more profit (a prime example of Flash technology). New developers are already coming to development environments in which simplicity is above all and they are simply afraid to go down a level, they think that black magic is going on there, and when they encounter a problem at a lower level, they think that it is enough to go to stackoveflow or write an issue on github and there are already dark lords lower levels versed in black magic just solve the problem.

Devs are getting spoiled. They have these monster CPUs, and terabytes of memory, and believe the purpose is to consume as much as possible - Instead of conserving as much as possible. I made a point out of ensuring Magic can run on ""dust"" when I implemented its backend parts, and Hyperlambda, optimising it into oblivion, to the point where you can have the thing running on a Raspberry Pi if you wish.

Today we have embraced the concept of open source, where code libraries are reviewed and commented on and improved by thousands of developers, who see the value in contributing to the development of the best wheel that we can build with our collective knowledge. Sure there are inexperienced devs who chose (often for bad reasons) to use code libraries that are not well maintained. The other reason why software has more files and bytes now, is because the capabilities they can make use of, have increased dramatically. For example, web browsers can render 3d animations now. No computer could render anything in 3d in 1970s."", 'Yes, you are right, this is the problem with libraries, where everyone is trying to add something of their own. And when business requires a ready-made solution here and now, of course it is easier for a developer to connect such a ready-made library, from which he needs one feature out of 5000 🤪\nHere we can smoothly switch to browsers: the problem is not in new features, because most sites do not use 3d, and in fact surfing ordinary text pages has gone not very far from the 2000s. The problem is that the sites are almost entirely composed of crappy code, which is why one page eats up hundreds megabytes.\nWeb browsers themselves are no better - they, like many applications, grow over time until they turn into monsters that contain another operating system of their own (sometimes two or more). It seems that in the end they must die under tons of their own unsupported code. But for some reason they never die. 😵', 'I propose to call this problem the ""Problem of the French Scribes"". There is a legend explaining why in French words there are many more letters in writing than they are pronounced (sometimes only one sound is pronounced out of 5 letters) - in ancient times, when there were very few literate people, and paper documents were already in circulation, scribes took bribes from clients for each letter. So they cheated quite good amounts for writing simple texts. Smart-ass puffed-up turkeys 😄 This is only speculation of course, but it is quite logical.', 'By the way, as far as I remember, when writing The Three Musketeers, Dumas was paid for the number of lines (like some programmers). Therefore, he specifically came up with monosyllabic characters with a bunch of stingy dialogues, for example, Grimaud Athos\'s servant.\nIn the end, the writer was told that lines that took up less than half a column would not be paid. Then he even thought about removing Grimaud from the story.\nBut ten years later, the writer was paid for the number of words - and Grimaud became more talkative.
